## React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project

- **Components**: Functional and class-based components used to build the user interface.
- **Props**: Data passed from parent components to child components to ensure reusability.
- **State Management**: Used to manage the state of the app for dynamic content (e.g., cart, wishlist).
- **Event Handling**: Event handlers like `onClick` used to trigger actions like adding products to the cart.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Display different UI elements based on the application state, such as showing the cart items or an empty cart message.
- **React Router**: Implemented routing to handle navigation between pages like Home, Product Details, Cart, etc.
- **Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` used for managing state and side effects in functional components.
- **Context API**: Used for managing global state (like user authentication, theme settings, or cart contents) across components.

## Data Handling and Management

- **Context API**: Used for managing global state across components (e.g., cart data, user preferences).
- **Local Storage**: Utilized to persist user cart and wishlist data even after page reloads.
